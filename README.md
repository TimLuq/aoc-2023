# TimLuq's Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

The solutions are written in Rust with a workspace containing a project for each day, which in turn contains a `src/bin/task{1,2}.rs` file for each part of the day's challenge.
